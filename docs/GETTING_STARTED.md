# Creating a New Meetup Group in Your City

Cloudnative ID is the parent organization/association for Kubernetes/Cloud Native (CNCF) Meetup Groups across Indonesia. We are supported by [CNCF Meetup Groups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf/). The official [CNCF meetup guideline](https://github.com/cncf/meetups) is recommended to be read.

Below you can find an ongoing non-exhaustive guide/checklist for starting a new Kubernetes/Cloud Native Meetup Group in your own city.

## Initial Preparation

- [ ] Make sure that there is no existing Kubernetes/Cloud Native Meetup Group in your city.
- [ ] Join the [Kubernetes Indonesia Telegram group](https://t.me/kubernetesindonesia) or [Cloud Native Indonesia Telegram group](https://t.me/microserviceid).
- [ ] Contact [@girikuncoro](https://t.me/girikuncoro) and state that you are interested in being the organizer of Kubernetes/Cloud Native Meetup in your local city chapter. You will be invited to the organizer's Telegram group. 
- [ ] It is recommended to find partners and other organizers to collaborate in the operational tasks of organizing the meetups. 3 (three) people should be good.
- [ ] After it is settled to proceed on the creation of the Meetup Group, create a new group on Meetup.com with the name of Kubernetes/Cloud Native `<Your city>`. 
- [ ] Description of the group can be taken from the examples of [Jakarta Kubernetes](https://www.meetup.com/jakarta-kubernetes/), [Microservice JKT/Cloud Native User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Microservice-JKT/), or [Kubernetes and Cloud Native Bandung](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-and-Cloud-Native-Bandung/).
- [ ] After successfully hosting 3 meetups, your city's meetup group can be included to CNCF Meetup Groups network! 
- [ ] You can use the image of Kubernetes or CNCF for the group image.

## Monthly Events

- [ ] It is encouraged to keep the group to **stay active** by hosting event once a month. It can be talks, workshops, study groups, etc. The number/quantity of participants/attendees should not be an issue.
- [ ] A form is provided to allow speakers to fill their talk proposals or hosts to fill their details. The form can be found at the CNCF-ID Drive.
- [ ] Usually, the format of the monthly event runs for around around 2 hours consisted of 2 speakers. The agenda can be seen as follows.

6:30 pm - 7:10 pm | Registration & Check In
7:10 pm - 7:20 pm | Welcoming & Introduction
7:20 pm - 7:50 pm | Speaker #1
7:50 pm - 8:20 pm | Speaker #2
8:20 pm - 8:35 pm | Q&A Panel
8:35 pm - 9:00 pm | Hallway Track

### Speakers

- [ ] Look for speakers that are interested in giving talks/presentations. You can reach to the local startups/companies, universities, or other tech communities.
- [ ] The topics should be around [Cloud Native landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io). Consult this to other organizers if you are not sure about the topic.

### Hosts/Venues

- [ ] Reach out to the local tech companies/startups or perhaps universities located around your city. Ask them whether they are interested in becoming the host of the monthly event.
- [ ] If they have an adequate area of the office, they will usually offer to use the auditorium/hall of the office. If not, you can offer them recommendations of public spaces/co-working spaces in your local city and they will sponsor in the form of the venue payment. 
- [ ] In return of sponsoring the event, offer them several benefits such as:
    - [ ] 1 (one) slot of speaker from the institution.
    - [ ] Logo of the institution will be shown in the publications below.
    - [ ] Several minutes at the event for the institutions to promote themselves.

### Publication and Meetup.com event

- [ ] After making sure that there are 2 speakers interested in giving presentation and 1 institution to host or sponsor the event, you can proceed to creating the publication of the particular month's event.
- [ ] Raise an issue in our [github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups](github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups) with the issue template that can be found [here]([https://github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/create-meetup-event.md](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/create-meetup-event.md)).
- [ ] Made a simple poster consisting of the information of the events (date, time, location, speakers photo, speakers name, speakers organisations, name of the event). Example can be seen [here](https://www.meetup.com/jakarta-kubernetes/events/259186080/) or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eH9ofLdQ-YSSnPHtwaaureT4LYdyPEi1/view?usp=sharing). You can also use our poster generator [here]([https://github.com/cloudnative-id/artwork/tree/master/poster/generator](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/artwork/tree/master/poster/generator)) with the tutorial written there. 
- [ ] Create a new event at the Meetup.com group with the details recommended as below:
    - [ ] #(number of how many events has been held) "short title of talk 1" & "short title of talk 2".
    - [ ] FAQ of the event.     
    - [ ] Welcoming message.
    - [ ] Location details of the venue.
    - [ ] For every talk:
        - [ ] Title of the talk.
        - [ ] Name of the speaker + role and organization.
        - [ ] Short bio of the speaker.
        - [ ] Abstract of the talk.
    - [ ] Agenda of the event.
    - [ ] Community leaders/organizers info and social media account.
- [ ] Example of the past events can be found at the Jakarta and Bandung meetups.
- [ ] You can set the RSVP's slot of 30%/40% more than the venue's capacity because there will usually be a drop rate of the attendees.
- [ ] It is encouraged to publish the event info around 1 week before the D-Day.
- [ ] It is recommended to record the event and speakers' talks and then upload it to video hosting site. The detailed instruction on this can be found [here]([https://github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups/blob/master/docs/RECORDING_MEETUP_EVENT.md](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups/blob/master/docs/RECORDING_MEETUP_EVENT.md)). 

### Community Slide
- [ ] A slide containing information for the community is usually made for each of the routine meetups. It usually contains the recent updates on Kubernetes/Cloud Native technologies, other related events, and news from the community.

### Centralized Repository and Document
- [ ] All of the documents belong to your city meetup group can be placed inside the CNCF-ID Google Drive under the folder of `<your city name>`.
- [ ] Do not forget to upload the speaker's deck to the [cloudnative-id/meetups](github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups) under the folder of `<your city name>` so that it can be accessed by everyone.

### Closing
Do not forget to enjoy and have fun! Nurturing and growing the community should be a fun and enjoyable thing to do for the organizers so that the positive energy and happiness can be radiated to all other members! Cheers! :blush: :blush:
