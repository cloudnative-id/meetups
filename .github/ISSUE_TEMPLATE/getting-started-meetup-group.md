## New City Meetup Group: <Your City>

## Steps

<!--
These are a non-exhaustive steps required on initiating a new meetup group in your city.

Update the checklist accordingly.
-->

## Preparing the Meetup Group Creation
- [ ] Read an official document from CNCF on [Meetup's Best Practices](https://github.com/cncf/meetups#meetup-best-practices).
- [ ] Make sure that there is no existing Kubernetes/Cloud Native Meetup group in your city. The list can be found [here](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups/blob/master/README.md). 
- [ ] If you do not find your city in the list, please suggest the creation of a new meetup in your city in our [Telegram group](https://t.me/kubernetesindonesia) (mention @girikuncoro or @imrenagi).
- [ ] You can create your own Meetup Group first before it will be officially included in the membership of CNCF Meetup Groups but you have to maintain payment subscription for the first 3 meetups. The steps can be found in the next section.
- [ ] Or you can reach out to CNCF Ambassador **@girikuncoro** on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/girikuncoro) or [Telegram](https://t.me/girikuncoro) to let him create one for you for **free**.

## Create the Meetup on Meetup.com

*(You can skip this step by asking @girikuncoro to create one for you, but feel free if you want to do it yourself)*

- [ ] Go to [https://meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and create an account there.
- [ ] Create the meetup group on meetup.com. The naming used is Kubernetes-Cloud-Native-`City`, because people know about Kubernetes, but not Cloud Native yet. Jakarta is exception because we started first.
- [ ] Find some local organizers that will assist and collaborate with you in the creation of the meetup.com group. 3 (three) people should be good to go.
- [ ] Follow the guides for creating a new [meetup group](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882111-Starting-a-Meetup-group).
- [ ] Follow the guide for creating the [first event](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002881251).
- [ ] Description of the group can be taken from the examples of [Jakarta Kubernetes](https://www.meetup.com/jakarta-kubernetes/), [Microservice JKT/Cloud Native User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Microservice-JKT/), or [Kubernetes and Cloud Native Bandung](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-and-Cloud-Native-Bandung/).
- [ ] Remember to use the [artwork](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/artwork) for the Meetup group and the event.

- [ ] If everything is good, congratulations! Thank you for initiating and organizing a chapter of Kubernetes/Cloud Native meetup group in your city!
- [ ] The exciting part is of course in maintaining the group to **stay active**. You can continue to look for this in [our doc](https://github.com/cloudnative-id/meetups/blob/master/docs/GETTING_STARTED_MEETUP_GROUP.md) on the Monthly Events section. Don't forget to enjoy and have fun!
